# My-Todo-List iOS App

## Introduction

Welcome to My Todo List App, an iOS app built with SwiftUI that helps you manage your tasks efficiently. This app is designed to be a user-friendly task manager that allows you to add, view, edit, and delete tasks effortlessly. I also implement industry best practice while developing the app such as MVVM design pattern, singleton and unit tests.

## Features

1. Task Management: Easily create, view, edit, and delete tasks through an intuitive user interface.
2. Core Data Integration: The app utilizes Core Data to store tasks locally on your device, ensuring persistent data storage.
3. Add New Tasks: Seamlessly add new tasks to the database, complete with a title, description, and due date.
4. Task List: View all your tasks in a scrollable list, presenting essential details at a glance.
5. Task Editing: Modify existing tasks by updating their title, description, or due date to keep your tasks up-to-date.
6. Task Deletion: Delete tasks from the list to remove completed or unwanted items, maintaining a clean and organized task list.
7. Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures a smooth user experience, addressing potential issues like database errors or data inconsistencies.
